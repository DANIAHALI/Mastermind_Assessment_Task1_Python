The Scenario: A mother applied for her son ("John Smith") in 2023 but was waitlisted. Today, the father applies for the same son ("John Smith") using a different email address and phone number on our Webflow form.
The Trap: A standard "Email Deduplication" script would create a duplicate lead because the father's email is different.

Specific Constraint: We do not want to merge the records automatically. Instead, the system should flag the new lead as "Possible Duplicate" and link it to the existing Family account. Explain how you structure the "Family vs. Student" module relationship in Zoho to allow this.
